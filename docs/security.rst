Security
========

zipwire fetches data from remote servers and parses binary ZIP
structures.  When processing archives from untrusted sources, keep the
following risks in mind.

Zip bombs
---------

A *zip bomb* is a malicious archive containing entries that decompress
to a vastly larger size than their compressed representation, potentially
exhausting memory or disk space.

Both :meth:`~zipwire.SyncRemoteZip.read` and
:meth:`~zipwire.SyncRemoteZip.read_into` (and their async equivalents)
accept a ``max_file_size`` keyword argument that limits the uncompressed
size of a single entry:

.. code-block:: python

   from zipwire import SyncRemoteZip
   from zipwire.backends import Urllib3Reader

   reader = Urllib3Reader("https://example.com/untrusted.zip")
   with SyncRemoteZip(reader) as rz:
       for info in rz.infolist():
           data = rz.read(info, max_file_size=50 * 1024 * 1024)  # 50 MiB

When the limit is exceeded, :exc:`~zipwire.FileTooLarge` is raised.

**Two layers of protection:**

1. **Pre-check** -- before decompression starts, the entry's declared
   ``file_size`` from the central directory is compared against the limit.
   This catches honest zip bombs with no overhead.

2. **Streaming enforcement** (:meth:`read_into` only) -- the streaming
   decompressor tracks the actual decompressed output and aborts if it
   exceeds the limit.  This catches crafted archives that lie about their
   uncompressed size in the metadata.

:meth:`read` performs only the pre-check (layer 1).  Because it
decompresses the entire entry into memory in one step, it cannot enforce
the limit during decompression.  Use :meth:`read_into` when processing
untrusted archives for defence in depth.

You can also inspect entries before extracting them:

.. code-block:: python

   MAX_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100 MiB

   with SyncRemoteZip(reader) as rz:
       for info in rz.infolist():
           if info.file_size > MAX_SIZE:
               print(f"Skipping {info.filename}: too large ({info.file_size} bytes)")
               continue
           data = rz.read(info)

Path traversal
--------------

ZIP archives can contain entries with absolute paths or ``../``
components (e.g. ``../../etc/passwd``).  zipwire does **not** extract
files to disk, so this is not a direct risk.  However, if you use
filenames from the archive to construct file paths, always sanitise them:

.. code-block:: python

   import os

   with SyncRemoteZip(reader) as rz:
       for info in rz.infolist():
           # Reject absolute paths and path traversal
           if os.path.isabs(info.filename) or ".." in info.filename.split("/"):
               print(f"Skipping suspicious path: {info.filename}")
               continue
           dest = os.path.join(output_dir, info.filename)
           # Verify the resolved path is inside output_dir
           if not os.path.realpath(dest).startswith(os.path.realpath(output_dir)):
               print(f"Skipping path traversal: {info.filename}")
               continue

Server trust
------------

zipwire sends HTTP requests to a URL you provide.  The server controls
what data is returned.  A malicious server could return crafted responses
designed to exploit ZIP parsing bugs, cause excessive memory use, or
return different data for different range requests.

- Only fetch archives from servers you trust.
- Use HTTPS to prevent tampering in transit.
- Consider setting ``max_file_size`` even for trusted servers as a
  safety net.
